What about...
why...
Who are you/...
sing song...
Watch the film///
Play the paino...
Do dance...

Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us, only sky

Imagine all the people
Livin' for today
Ah
magine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion, too
